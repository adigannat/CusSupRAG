## What is Amazon S3?
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Millions of customers of all sizes and industries store, manage, analyze, and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize and analyze data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business and compliance requirements.

## Benefits

Scalability
You can store virtually any amount of data with S3 all the way to exabytes with unmatched performance. S3 is fully elastic, automatically growing and shrinking as you add and remove data. There's no need to provision storage, and you pay only for what you use.

Durability and availability
Amazon S3 provides the most durable storage in the cloud and industry leading availability. Based on its unique architecture, S3 is designed to provide 99.999999999% (11 nines) data durability and 99.99% availability by default, backed by the strongest SLAs in the cloud.

Security and data protection
Protect your data with unmatched security, data protection, compliance, and access control capabilities. S3 is secure, private, and encrypted by default, and also supports numerous auditing capabilities to monitor access requests to your S3 resources.

Lowest price and highest performance
S3 delivers multiple storage classes with the best price performance for any workload and automated data lifecycle management, so you can store massive amounts of frequently, infrequently, or rarely accessed data in a cost-efficient way. S3 delivers the resiliency, flexibility, latency, and throughput, to ensure storage never limits performance.

## Use cases

Data lakes

Backup and restore data

Archive data

Generative AI
Build a data lake
A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can run data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and high-performance computing (HPC) applications to unlock the value of your data.

With an Amazon S3 data lake, users in Salesforce's organization can discover, access, and analyze all their data, regardless of where it lives, in a secure and governed way.

Backup and restore critical data
Meet your recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), and compliance requirements with S3's robust replication functionality, data protection with AWS Backup, and various AWS Partner Network solutions.

Archive data at the lowest cost
Move data archives to the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes to lower costs, eliminate operational complexities, and gain new insights.

The BBC, a UK public service broadcaster, safely migrated its 100-year-old flagship archive to Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.

Put your data to work
Because Amazon S3 stores more than 350 trillion objects (exabytes of data) for virtually any use case and averages over 100 million requests per second, it may be the starting point of your generative AI journey.
